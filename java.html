                <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.<br><br><a href="Variable Declaration" style="background-color: darkblue">Variable Declaration</a> - JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called indentifiers. var x;<br><br><a href="Variable Assignments" style="background-color: darkblue">Variable Assignments</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;<br><br><a href="Data Types" style="background-color: darkblue">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean- true or false; null-null aka nothing; Number-42 or 3.14159; String-"Coding Dojo Rocks!:; Array-[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object-{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}<br><br><a href="Conditionals" style="background-color: darkblue">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accompolist this. There are the following conditional statements; if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block: else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is fals: else we execute this block of code;<br><br><a href="Loops" style="background-color: darkblue">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you rujn around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!<br><br><a href="Function" style="background-color: darkblue">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will ruin that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get start, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up, Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</a></p>
